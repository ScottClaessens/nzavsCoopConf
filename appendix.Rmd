## Supplementary Methods

### Power analysis

The minimum size of our sample was determined by conducting a power analysis on data from @Peysakhovich2014. We used the smallest significant correlation between economic game play and real-world cooperation in that study as the effect size (_r_ = 0.15). G*Power [@Faul2007] suggested a sample of 571 participants to detect this correlation effect size with statistical power of 0.95. We aimed to sample 1000 participants, substantially above this amount, and eventually report data from 991 participants.

### Sample frame in Study 1

From the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, we included participants in our sample frame who: had completed Wave 4 of the study (_n_ = 12,189); had also completed Wave 9 and/or Wave 10 (_n_ = 8,095); had not subsequently withdrawn from the study at the time of sampling (_n_ = 7,833); had consistently indicated at Wave 9 and 10 that they would be willing to participate in an additional online study (_n_ = 4,181); had a valid email address (_n_ = 4,040); were living in New Zealand (_n_ = 3,955); were younger than 70 at the time of sampling (_n_ = 3,374); and had a valid cell or landline number (_n_ = 3,345). Of these 3,345 participants, we attempted to contact 3,063 about an additional study involving "economic decision-making in groups", and successfully contacted 2,731 about the study.

### Additional information about study sessions in Studies 1 and 2

In Study 1, participants expressed interest in an initial phone call and were then emailed further information about the study. In Study 2, they were just sent an initial email. In both studies, the email asked them to complete a Qualtrics survey to specify their availability the following week. This survey removed any ineligible participants who (1) did not have adequate access to the Internet, (2) did not have a quiet place to participate in the study, and (3) did not have a New Zealand bank account (for payment purposes). 

At the beginning of the study, participants first completed a consent form, in which they were informed of their confidentiality, right to withdraw, payment, and ethical approval. If they agreed to the consent form, participants read information about the economic games and then completed the games in a random order. After being randomly matched at the end of the session, participants saw a payoff screen which summarised the results of each individual game and how much they had earned from the study. Name and bank account details were collected at the end of the study. For security purposes, this information was encrypted while stored online and later decrypted on a local computer for payment. 

Participants had a 55 minute limit to complete the games. If participants took longer than 55 minutes, the software skipped them ahead to the waiting lobby. Timeouts were still paid the \$20 show-up fee, but no bonus payment.

### Uneven session sizes in Studies 1 and 2

In Studies 1 and 2, session sizes were often not strict multiples of four necessary for real-time random matching, either due to unforeseen dropouts or uneven sign-ups. To remedy this, "simulated players" were used to round up uneven session sizes. These simulated players chose responses in the games based on the median responses from Peysakhovich et al. (2014). Participants were made aware that they may be matched with simulated players, but only on the payoff screen _after_ all game decisions had been made: "In the rare event that we could not find a participant to match you with, we have instead matched you with average decisions based on previous research."

## Supplementary Results

### Confirmatory factor analyses in Study 1

```{r echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
loadd(cfa1)
loadd(cfa2)
```

As with our principal components analysis, we initially restricted our confirmatory factor model to include only the games used in previous work [@Peysakhovich2014]. Controlling for game comprehension, we loaded the Dictator Game, Trust Game (Give), Trust Game (Return), and Public Goods Game onto the cooperation latent variable, and loaded the Ultimatum Game (Minimum Acceptable Offer), Third-Party Punishment Game (Punish), and Second-Party Punishment Game (Punish Defector) onto the punishment latent variable. According to established fit statistic cutoffs [@Hu1999;@MacCallum1996], this model fitted the data well, with a Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) value of `r printnum(as.numeric(fitMeasures(cfa1)['rmsea']))`, a Standardised Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) value of `r printnum(as.numeric(fitMeasures(cfa1)['srmr']))`, and a Comparative Fit Index (CFI) value of `r printnum(as.numeric(fitMeasures(cfa1)['cfi']))`. All indicators had significantly positive loadings, and the two latent variables were significantly negatively correlated with one another (_r_ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(cfa1)[25,4])`, _p_ = `r printp(parameterEstimates(cfa1)[25,7])`; Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:cfa1Plot)). Model fit improved further when additionally loading the Stag Hunt Game onto the cooperation latent variable and loading the Stag Hunt Game with Punishment (Punish Defector) onto the punishment latent variable (RMSEA = `r printnum(as.numeric(fitMeasures(cfa2)['rmsea']))`; SRMR = `r printnum(as.numeric(fitMeasures(cfa2)['srmr']))`; CFI = `r printnum(as.numeric(fitMeasures(cfa2)['cfi']))`; Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:cfa2Plot)).
